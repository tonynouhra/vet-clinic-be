# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Clerk authentication integration for the vet clinic backend API. Clerk will provide user authentication, session management, and user profile handling for the veterinary clinic platform. The integration will secure API endpoints and provide user context for appointments, pet management, and clinic operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a vet clinic staff member, I want to authenticate using Clerk so that I can securely access the clinic management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid Clerk credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to protected endpoints
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the authentication attempt and return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN an authenticated user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate their session token and allow access to authorized resources
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing further access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to register and login through Clerk so that I can manage my pet's appointments and medical records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a user profile in both Clerk and the local database
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL synchronize their Clerk profile with local user data
3. WHEN a user updates their profile in Clerk THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in the local database
4. WHEN a user is deleted from Clerk THEN the system SHALL handle the user deletion appropriately in the local system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control through Clerk so that different user types have appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is assigned a role in Clerk THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions for API endpoints
2. WHEN a veterinarian accesses the system THEN they SHALL have full access to patient records and appointment management
3. WHEN a pet owner accesses the system THEN they SHALL only access their own pets and appointments
4. WHEN a clinic staff member accesses the system THEN they SHALL have appropriate administrative permissions based on their role

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure API endpoint protection so that only authenticated users can access sensitive veterinary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated request is made to a protected endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
2. WHEN a request is made with an invalid or expired token THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
3. WHEN a request is made with insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
4. WHEN JWT tokens are validated THEN the system SHALL verify the signature using Clerk's public keys

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want webhook support for Clerk events so that user changes are automatically synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created in Clerk THEN the system SHALL receive a webhook and create corresponding local user data
2. WHEN a user is updated in Clerk THEN the system SHALL receive a webhook and update local user data accordingly
3. WHEN a user is deleted in Clerk THEN the system SHALL receive a webhook and handle user deletion appropriately
4. WHEN webhook requests are received THEN the system SHALL verify the webhook signature for security

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for authentication events so that I can monitor and troubleshoot authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN successful authentications occur THEN the system SHALL log user access for audit purposes
3. WHEN Clerk API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful error responses
4. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
