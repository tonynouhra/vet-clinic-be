# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a dynamic testing framework that eliminates code duplication across API versions by creating parameterized, version-aware tests. The system will use configuration-driven testing to automatically test endpoints across multiple API versions (v1, v2, and future versions) while handling version-specific features, fields, and behaviors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write tests once and have them automatically run against all API versions, so that I can maintain consistent test coverage without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is written using the dynamic framework THEN it SHALL automatically execute against all configured API versions
2. WHEN a new API version is added THEN existing tests SHALL automatically include the new version without code changes
3. WHEN version-specific features are tested THEN the framework SHALL skip tests for versions that don't support those features
4. WHEN test data is generated THEN it SHALL be appropriate for the target API version's schema and capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want version-specific configurations to be externalized, so that I can easily manage differences between API versions without hardcoding them in tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API version configurations are defined THEN they SHALL be stored in external configuration files
2. WHEN version configurations include endpoint URLs THEN they SHALL be automatically used in test requests
3. WHEN version configurations specify supported features THEN tests SHALL conditionally execute based on feature availability
4. WHEN version configurations define required/optional fields THEN test data generation SHALL respect these constraints
5. WHEN configurations are updated THEN tests SHALL automatically reflect the changes without code modifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test data factories that generate version-appropriate data, so that tests use valid data structures for each API version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test data is requested for a specific version THEN the factory SHALL generate data matching that version's schema
2. WHEN v1 data is generated THEN it SHALL only include fields supported by v1 endpoints
3. WHEN v2 data is generated THEN it SHALL include enhanced fields like temperament, behavioral_notes, and emergency_contact
4. WHEN invalid combinations are requested THEN the factory SHALL raise appropriate errors
5. WHEN expected response fields are requested THEN the factory SHALL return the correct field list for each version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want base test classes with version-aware utilities, so that I can easily build tests that work across versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test class inherits from BaseVersionTest THEN it SHALL have access to version-aware utility methods
2. WHEN endpoint URLs are built THEN they SHALL use the correct base path for the specified version
3. WHEN feature availability is checked THEN the method SHALL return true/false based on version capabilities
4. WHEN version-specific test execution is needed THEN the framework SHALL provide a standardized way to run tests
5. WHEN features are not supported in a version THEN tests SHALL be automatically skipped with appropriate messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parameterized tests that automatically test CRUD operations across versions, so that basic functionality is consistently validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRUD tests are executed THEN they SHALL run against all configured API versions
2. WHEN create operations are tested THEN they SHALL use version-appropriate request data
3. WHEN read operations are tested THEN they SHALL validate version-specific response fields
4. WHEN update operations are tested THEN they SHALL handle version-specific field differences
5. WHEN delete operations are tested THEN they SHALL work consistently across versions
6. WHEN list operations are tested THEN they SHALL validate version-specific response structures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want feature-specific tests that only run on versions supporting those features, so that I can test advanced functionality without breaking older versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health records tests are executed THEN they SHALL only run on v2 and later versions
2. WHEN statistics tests are executed THEN they SHALL only run on versions that support statistics
3. WHEN enhanced filtering tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate version-specific filter capabilities
4. WHEN batch operations are tested THEN they SHALL only execute on supporting versions
5. WHEN unsupported features are accessed THEN tests SHALL verify appropriate error responses (404, etc.)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the testing framework to be easily extensible for new versions, so that adding v3, v4, etc. requires minimal effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new API version is added THEN only configuration updates SHALL be required
2. WHEN new features are introduced THEN they SHALL be easily added to the feature testing system
3. WHEN new endpoints are added THEN they SHALL automatically be included in parameterized tests
4. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN the framework SHALL handle them through configuration
5. WHEN backward compatibility is maintained THEN existing tests SHALL continue to work unchanged
