# API Architecture Restructure Requirements

## Introduction

The current API architecture mixes business logic, request handling, and data access in the endpoint files. This restructuring will implement a clean separation of concerns with a controller-service pattern for each resource, with proper API versioning support, improving maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resource-Based Package Structure with Version-Agnostic Business Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each API resource to have its own package with clean separation of concerns and version-agnostic business logic, so that code is organized, maintainable, and versions can share the same business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing API resources THEN the system SHALL create separate packages for each resource (users, pets, appointments, etc.) that are version-agnostic
2. WHEN structuring each resource package THEN the system SHALL include controller.py and services.py files (schemas moved to version-specific locations)
3. WHEN accessing business logic THEN the system SHALL follow the flow: API endpoint → Controller → Services
4. WHEN organizing common functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain app_helpers package for shared utilities
5. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL create app_tests/ directory with unit/, functional/, and integration/ subdirectories
6. WHEN implementing API versioning THEN controllers and services SHALL be shared across all API versions

### Requirement 2: Version-Specific API Layer Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API versions to only differ at the routing and schema level, so that business logic is shared while API contracts can evolve independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API versioning THEN each version SHALL have its own routing definitions
2. WHEN implementing API versioning THEN each version SHALL have its own request/response schemas
3. WHEN implementing API versioning THEN all versions SHALL use the same controllers and services
4. WHEN adding new API versions THEN existing versions SHALL remain unaffected
5. WHEN evolving API contracts THEN business logic SHALL not need duplication

### Requirement 3: Controller Layer Implementation (Version-Agnostic)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want controllers to handle HTTP methods and orchestrate business operations across all API versions, so that business logic is centralized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing HTTP requests THEN controllers SHALL accept parameters from any API version
2. WHEN handling responses THEN controllers SHALL work with any version-specific schema
3. WHEN coordinating operations THEN controllers SHALL orchestrate service calls and implement business logic
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN controllers SHALL verify user permissions before proceeding
5. WHEN handling version differences THEN controllers SHALL gracefully handle optional parameters from different versions

### Requirement 4: Service Layer Implementation (Version-Agnostic)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want services to handle data access and core business logic independently of API versions, so that database operations and business rules are encapsulated and shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN services SHALL handle all database operations regardless of API version
2. WHEN implementing business rules THEN services SHALL contain core business logic shared across versions
3. WHEN managing entities THEN services SHALL handle entity lifecycle operations
4. WHEN integrating external systems THEN services SHALL manage third-party API calls
5. WHEN supporting new API versions THEN services SHALL not require modification

### Requirement 5: Version-Specific Schema Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Pydantic schemas to be version-specific, so that API contracts can evolve while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining API contracts THEN schemas SHALL be organized by API version (v1, v2, etc.)
2. WHEN validating input data THEN version-specific schemas SHALL provide appropriate field validation
3. WHEN serializing responses THEN version-specific schemas SHALL ensure consistent output formatting for that version
4. WHEN adding new API versions THEN new schemas SHALL be created without affecting existing versions
5. WHEN handling nested data THEN schemas SHALL support complex data structures specific to their version

### Requirement 6: API Endpoint Restructure with Proper Versioning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API endpoints to be organized by version with thin wrappers that delegate to shared controllers, so that versioning is clean and business logic is not duplicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining API endpoints THEN they SHALL be organized by version (v1/, v2/, etc.)
2. WHEN processing requests THEN endpoints SHALL delegate immediately to version-agnostic controllers
3. WHEN organizing endpoints THEN they SHALL maintain RESTful URL patterns within each version
4. WHEN handling HTTP methods THEN each method SHALL have its own endpoint function
5. WHEN using schemas THEN endpoints SHALL use version-specific schemas for validation and responses

### Requirement 7: Common Helpers Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common functionality organized in app_helpers, so that reusable code is easily accessible across the application and all API versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing helpers THEN the system SHALL group related functions in logical modules
2. WHEN accessing authentication helpers THEN they SHALL be available in auth_helpers.py
3. WHEN using response helpers THEN they SHALL be available in response_helpers.py
4. WHEN validating data THEN validation helpers SHALL be available in validation_helpers.py
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN dependency injection helpers SHALL support version-agnostic controllers

### Requirement 8: Dependency Injection Pattern

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection throughout the layers with version-agnostic controllers, so that components are loosely coupled, testable, and reusable across API versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN controllers SHALL receive services via dependency injection
2. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN services SHALL receive database sessions via dependency injection
3. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN API endpoints SHALL receive controllers via dependency injection
4. WHEN testing components THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable
5. WHEN using controllers across versions THEN the same controller instance SHALL work with any API version

### Requirement 9: Testing Structure Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests organized in app_tests with separate folders for different test types, so that testing is structured, comprehensive, and covers version compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL create app_tests/ directory with unit/, functional/, integration/ subdirectories
2. WHEN writing unit tests THEN they SHALL test individual functions and methods in isolation
3. WHEN writing functional tests THEN they SHALL test complete feature workflows
4. WHEN writing integration tests THEN they SHALL test full API endpoint flows with database for each version
5. WHEN testing versioning THEN tests SHALL verify that controllers work correctly with all API versions

### Requirement 10: Error Handling Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling across all layers and API versions, so that errors are properly propagated and handled uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in services THEN they SHALL raise appropriate business exceptions
2. WHEN errors occur in controllers THEN they SHALL catch service exceptions and add context
3. WHEN errors occur in API endpoints THEN they SHALL catch controller exceptions and return version-appropriate HTTP responses
4. WHEN logging errors THEN each layer SHALL log appropriate context information
5. WHEN handling errors across versions THEN error responses SHALL be formatted according to the specific API version

### Requirement 11: Migration Strategy with Versioning Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear migration strategy from the current structure that properly implements versioning, so that the transition is smooth and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing code THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transition
2. WHEN restructuring files THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure all references are updated correctly
4. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL remove old unused files and imports
5. WHEN implementing versioning THEN existing API functionality SHALL be preserved as v1
6. WHEN preparing for future versions THEN the architecture SHALL support easy addition of v2, v3, etc.
