## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Version-Agnostic Design**: Controllers and services work across API versions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between API, Controller, Service, and Model layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper dependency management for database sessions and services

### Database Models
- **Pet Model**: Comprehensive pet information with relationships
- **HealthRecord Model**: Detailed health record tracking with audit trail
- **Reminder Model**: Automated reminder system with recurrence support

### API Schemas
- **V1 Schemas**: Complete request/response validation for all endpoints
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with business rule enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Services
- **PetService**: Core business logic for pet management
- **NotificationService**: Multi-channel notification system (email, SMS, push)
- **Background Tasks**: Celery integration for automated reminder processing

### Key Features Implemented

#### Health Record Management
```python
# Automatic reminder scheduling when adding health records
await controller.add_health_record(
    pet_id=pet_id,
    record_data={
        "record_type": "vaccination",
        "title": "Annual Rabies Vaccination",
        "next_due_date": "2025-01-15"  # Automatically creates reminder
    }
)
```

#### Reminder System
```python
# Comprehensive reminder management
await controller.create_reminder(
    pet_id=pet_id,
    reminder_data={
        "title": "Vaccination Reminder",
        "reminder_type": "vaccination",
        "due_date": "2025-01-15",
        "reminder_date": "2025-01-08",
        "is_recurring": False
    }
)
```

#### Notification Integration
```python
# Multi-channel notification support
await notification_service.send_reminder_notification(
    user=pet_owner,
    pet=pet,
    reminder=reminder,
    channels=['email', 'sms', 'push']
)
```
