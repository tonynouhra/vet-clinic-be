  - Real-time availability checking for veterinarians at specific clinics
  - Duration-based slot filtering
  - Date range support for availability searches
  - Integration with appointment slot management system

### 2. Calendar View API with Veterinarian Availability ✅
- **New API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/appointments/calendar`
- **Functionality**:
  - Multiple view types (day, week, month)
  - Combined view of appointments and available slots
  - Veterinarian and clinic filtering
  - Structured calendar data with appointments and availability

### 3. Appointment Confirmation and Reminder Notification System ✅
- **Background Task System**: Implemented Celery-based notification tasks
- **Notification Types**:
  - 24-hour appointment reminders
  - 2-hour appointment reminders
  - Appointment confirmation notifications
  - Appointment cancellation notifications
  - Appointment reschedule notifications
- **Multi-channel Support**: Email, SMS, and push notifications
- **Automated Scheduling**: Periodic reminder tasks with database tracking

### 4. Appointment Cancellation and Rescheduling Endpoints ✅
- **Enhanced Existing Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/appointments/{id}/cancel` - with notification integration
  - `POST /api/v1/appointments/{id}/reschedule` - with conflict checking and notifications
  - `POST /api/v1/appointments/{id}/confirm` - with confirmation notifications

### 5. Conflict Detection and Resolution Logic ✅
- **New API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/appointments/check-conflicts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Real-time conflict detection before booking
  - Time overlap validation
  - Veterinarian schedule conflict checking
  - Integration with appointment creation workflow

### 6. Integration Tests for Appointment Scheduling Workflows ✅
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: `tests/integration/test_appointment_scheduling.py`
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Availability checking workflows
  - Calendar view functionality
  - Conflict detection scenarios
  - Complete appointment lifecycle (create, confirm, start, complete)
  - Notification system integration
  - Status transition workflows
  - Filtering and search functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Enhancements
- **Version-Agnostic Design**: All functionality works across API versions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation between API, Controller, and Service layers
- **Async Processing**: Background tasks for notifications using Celery
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries with proper indexing and relationships

### New Files Created
1. `app/tasks/appointment_tasks.py` - Background notification tasks
2. `tests/integration/test_appointment_scheduling.py` - Comprehensive integration tests

### Enhanced Files
1. `app/api/v1/appointments.py` - Added scheduling-specific endpoints
2. `app/appointments/controller.py` - Added scheduling methods and notification integration
3. `app/appointments/services.py` - Added availability, calendar, and conflict detection services
4. `app/services/notification_service.py` - Added appointment-specific notification methods

### Database Integration
- **Appointment Slots**: Utilizes existing `AppointmentSlot` model for availability management
- **Conflict Detection**: Advanced SQL queries for time overlap detection
- **Reminder Tracking**: Database fields for tracking sent reminders
- **Relationship Management**: Proper foreign key relationships with users, pets, veterinarians, and clinics

## API Endpoints Summary

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/appointments/availability` - Get available appointment slots
- `GET /api/v1/appointments/calendar` - Get calendar view with appointments and availability
- `POST /api/v1/appointments/check-conflicts` - Check for appointment conflicts

### Enhanced Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/appointments/` - Now includes availability checking and conflict detection
- `POST /api/v1/appointments/{id}/cancel` - Now triggers notification tasks
- `POST /api/v1/appointments/{id}/reschedule` - Now includes conflict checking and notifications
- `POST /api/v1/appointments/{id}/confirm` - Enhanced with notification integration

## Background Tasks
- `send_appointment_reminders` - Periodic task for sending appointment reminders
- `send_appointment_confirmation` - Task for sending confirmation notifications
- `send_appointment_cancellation` - Task for sending cancellation notifications
- `send_appointment_reschedule` - Task for sending reschedule notifications

## Requirements Fulfillment

### Requirement 3.1: Real-time Veterinarian Availability ✅
- Implemented availability checking API with real-time slot data
- Integration with appointment slot management system
- Duration-based filtering and date range support

### Requirement 3.2: Conflict Validation and Confirmed Appointments ✅
- Advanced conflict detection logic with time overlap validation
- Automatic conflict checking during appointment creation
- Proper appointment confirmation workflow with status tracking

### Requirement 3.3: Background Notification Tasks ✅
- Comprehensive reminder system with 24-hour and 2-hour notifications
- Multi-channel notification support (email, SMS, push)
- Automated task scheduling with database tracking

### Requirement 3.4: Data Consistency and Party Updates ✅
- Proper transaction management for appointment modifications
- Notification system ensures all parties are informed of changes
- Database consistency maintained through proper relationship management

## Testing and Quality Assurance
